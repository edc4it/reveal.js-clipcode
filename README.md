## Reveal.js Code Snippet Copier

Enhance your Reveal.js presentations with an intuitive 'copy' button on all code blocks. Our plugin simplifies the process of allowing viewers to copy code snippets directly from your slides.

This project is inspired by the exceptional contributions of [Martinomagnifico](https://github.com/Martinomagnifico) and his [CopyCode plugin](https://github.com/Martinomagnifico/reveal.js-copycode). Martinomagnifico's version offers a broader range of features and has undergone extensive testing. Should you require a more comprehensive solution, we highly recommend exploring the [CopyCode plugin](https://github.com/Martinomagnifico/reveal.js-copycode).

## Global options

There are a few options that you can change from the Reveal.js options. The values below are default and do not need to be set if they are not changed. Some of the options were previously not nested; those overrides will continue to work.

```javascript
Reveal.initialize({
  // ...
  clipcode: {
    timeout: 1000,
    style: {
      copybg: 'orange',
      copiedbg: 'green',
      copycolor: 'black',
      copiedcolor: 'white',
      copyborder: '',
      copiedborder: '',
      scale: 1,
      offset: 0,
      radius: 0,
    },
  },
  plugins: [ClipCode],
});
```

- `timeout`: The time in milliseconds for the "Copied!"-state to revert back to "Copy".
- `style`: This is an object that contains options for text in the buttons
  - `copybg`: The background color.
  - `copiedbg`: The background color in the Copied state.
